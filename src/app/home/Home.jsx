                <span className="first-character ny">B</span>reaking into the
                New York fashion world is no easy task. But by the early 2000's,
                UGG Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of UGG
                from a brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and
                sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now
                being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious
                lifestyle was swift. Much of this was due to a brand
                repositioning effort that transformed UGG into a high-end luxury
                footwear maker. As a fashion brand, UGG advertisements now
                graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as other fashion
                books. In the mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion
                was popping up all over the world and UGG was now perfectly
                aligned with this movement.

                Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing UGG boots and
                slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was
                carved out. As a result, the desire and love for UGG increased
                as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed UGG experience.
                UGG began offering numerous color and style variations on their
                sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for women and
                men and leather casuals were added with great success. What
                started as a niche item, UGG sheepskin boots were now a
                must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More UGG collections
                followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to
                wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel UGG is
                known for all over the world. UGG products were now seen on
                runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long,
                the love spread even further.

                The widespread love for UGG extended to Europe in the mid-2000's
                along with the stylish casual movement and demand for premium
                casual fashion. UGG boots and shoes were now seen walking the
                streets of London, Paris and Amsterdam with regularity. To meet
                the rising demand from new fans, UGG opened flagship stores in
                the UK and an additional location in Moscow. As the love spread
                farther East, concept stores were opened in Beijing, Shanghai
                and Tokyo. UGG Australia is now an international brand that is
                loved by all. This love is a result of a magical combination of
                the amazing functional benefits of sheepskin and the heightened
                emotional feeling you get when you slip them on your feet. In
                short, you just feel better all over when you wear UGG boots,
                slippers, and shoes.

                Italian shoemaking with the reliable magic of sheepskin,
                bringing the luxurious feel of UGG to high end fashion. As the
                love for UGG continues to spread across the world, we have
                continued to offer new and unexpected ways to experience the
                brand. The UGG journey continues on and the love for UGG
